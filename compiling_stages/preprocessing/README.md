### 预处理阶段

gcc编译器提供了一种模式，可以仅仅对输入文件执行预处理操作：

```
$ gcc -E <input file> -o <output preprocessed file>.i
```

对文件function.c执行与处理后的结果如下：

```
# 1 "function.c"
# 1 "<built-in>"
# 1 "<command-line>"
# 31 "<command-line>"
# 1 "/usr/include/stdc-predef.h" 1 3 4
# 32 "<command-line>" 2
# 1 "function.c"
# 1 "function.h" 1
       







float add_and_multiply(float x, float y);
# 2 "function.c" 2

int nCompletionStatus = 0;

float add(float x, float y)
{
    float z = x + y;
    return z;
}

float add_and_multiply(float x, float y)
{
    float z = add(x,y);
    z *= (3.0);
    return z;
}
```

如果向gcc传递一些额外参数，我们就能够得到更为简洁明了的预处理输出结果，
比如增加以下参数：

```
$ gcc -E -P <input file> -o <output preprocessed file>.i
```

对文件function.c执行与处理后的结果如下：

```
float add_and_multiply(float x, float y);
int nCompletionStatus = 0;
float add(float x, float y)
{
    float z = x + y;
    return z;
}
float add_and_multiply(float x, float y)
{
    float z = add(x,y);
    z *= (3.0);
    return z;
}
```

因为头文件可能相当大，如果源文件包括了多个头文件，那么它的预处理器输出可能会庞杂难读。  
使用-C选项会很有帮助，这个选项可以阻止预处理器删除源文件和头文件中的注释：

```
$ gcc -E -C <input file> -o <output preprocessed file>.i
```

对文件function.c执行与处理后的结果如下：

```
# 1 "function.c"
# 1 "<built-in>"
# 1 "<command-line>"
# 31 "<command-line>"
# 1 "/usr/include/stdc-predef.h" 1 3 4

# 1 "/usr/include/stdc-predef.h" 3 4
